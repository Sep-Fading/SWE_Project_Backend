## How to use the repository:
 - For any of the steps if you google how to do them you should get your answer, if you're unsure. Also can ask the group.

 - Obviously keep your code neat and well commented so people know what everything does and what your variables mean.

 - Give your variables, methods, css classes etc meaningful names.

### Use your own branches:
 - After cloning the files to your local device, make sure you are on your own branch and not main/master/someone else's branch. VERY IMPORTANT!

 - You can create and switch to a branch using terminal.

### Naming your branches:
 - You may want to make different branches for things you may want to test, in that case follow this naming convention:

 - YOURNAME_TITLE_VERSION

 - For example, sepehr_logintest_1

### Updating your work:

 - Commit and push your changes to your branch often and be descriptive in the description, to let others know what exactly changed and what was added or removed.

 - The master branch is protected and will need majority to approve the merge, so keep in touch regularly to communicate completed tasks.

### Setting up Django on your local device:

 - Make sure you have Python installed, you can check it using `python --version` or `python3 --version`
   
 - When working on your Django project, you will need to work in a virtual environment, python provides us with a way to do this:

 - In a folder dedicated to your work, using `python3 -m venv {NAME}` will create a virtual environment for you to work on locally. E.g. `python3 -m venv myenv`.

 - You will need to activate this before you work with Django. On Unix shells this is done with `source myenv/bin/activate`.

 - Usually when you install a dependency a requirement.txt file is autogenerated but keep note of what you install just in case.

 - To install dependencies from requirements.txt, `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

 - To run the Django server use `python3 manage.py runserver` inside the project directory.

 - You can access Django from a web browser by entering `localhost:8000`.
