## How to use the repository:

 - For any of the steps if you google how to do them you should get your answer, if you're unsure.

 - Obviously keep your code neat and well commented so people know what everything does and what your variables mean.

 - Give your variables, methods, css classes etc meaningful names.

### Use your own branches:
 - After cloning the files to your local device, make sure you are on your own branch and not main/master/someone else's branch. VERY IMPORTANT!

 - You can create and switch to a branch using terminal.

### Naming your branches:
 - You may want to make different branches for things you may want to test, in that case follow this naming convention:

 - YOURNAME_TITLE_VERSION

 - For example, sepehr_logintest_1

### Updating your work:

 - Commit and push your changes to your branch often and be descriptive in the description, to let others know what exactly changed and what was added or removed.

 - The master branch is protected and will need majority to approve the merge, so keep in touch regularly to communicate completed tasks.
