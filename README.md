## How to use the repository:

 - For any of the steps if you google how to do them you should get your answer, if you're unsure.

 - Obviously keep your code neat and well commented so people know what everything does and what your variables mean.

 - Give your variables, methods, css classes etc meaningful names.

### Use your own branches:
 - After cloning the files to your local device, make sure you are on your own branch and not main/master/someone else's branch. VERY IMPORTANT!

 - You can create and switch to a branch using terminal.

### Naming your branches:
 - You may want to make different branches for things you may want to test, in that case follow this naming convention:

 - YOURNAME_TITLE_VERSION

 - For example, sepehr_logintest_1

### Updating your work:

 - Commit and push your changes to your branch often and be descriptive in the description, to let others know what exactly changed and what was added or removed.

 - The master branch is protected and will need majority to approve the merge, so keep in touch regularly to communicate completed tasks.


### Installing Django on your local repo:

- Check that you have python installed using `python3 --version`.
- To work with django you need to create a dedicated folder on your local device.
- Once in said folder, you will need to create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv NAME`, e.g. `python3 -m venv myenv`.
- This virtual environment should be activated before working with Django.
- To activate, on Unix Shells use `source/myenv/bin/activate`.
- Then, install Django using `pip install Django`.
- Verify the installation of Django using `django-admin --version`.
- You can now clone the repository in the same folder you previously created.
- If you use any dependencies, they should be in `requirements.txt` which is autogenerated, however keep a note of them just in case.
- To install dependencies from an existing `requirements.txt`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Navigate into the Django project directory and run `python3 manage.py runserver`.
- This should start a local server for you accessible via `http://localhost:8000` on your web browser.
